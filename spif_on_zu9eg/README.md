SpiNNaker interface implemented on Zynq Ultascale+
==================================================

This repository contains an FPGA design to interface event-based
peripherals, such as event cameras or DVS, to a SpiNNaker system through
a High-Speed Serial Link (HSSL).

The design targets the Xilinx ZCU102 development board (ZYNQ Ultrascale+).
