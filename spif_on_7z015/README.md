SpiNNaker interface implemented on Zynq 7000
============================================

This repository contains an FPGA design to interface an event-based
sensor, such as an event camera or DVS, to a SpiNNaker system through
a High-Speed Serial Link (HSSL).

The design targets the Trenz Electronic TE7015-04-15 board (ZYNQ 7000).
It connects to the SpiNNaker system using a SATA cable.

The design is built on top of
[spI/O](https://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/spio), the library of
FPGA designs and reusable modules for I/O and internal connectivity in
SpiNNaker systems.
