SpiNNaker interface implemented on Zynq 7000
============================================

This repository contains an FPGA design to interface event-based
peripherals, such as event cameras or DVS, to a SpiNNaker system through
a High-Speed Serial Link (HSSL).

The design targets the Trenz Electronic TE7015-04-15 board (ZYNQ 7000).
